# Data_Analytics_Projects

used Python, Snowflake, SQL  and Amazaon S3 for doing this project.
First the huge json file is splitted in smaller files using python for faster ingestion ans uploaded it on S3.
From S3 taken the data into Snowflake and transformed the json data and created the tables in SQL. 
Solved some interesting SQL questions which also covers Sentiment analysis (Based on the reviews analyzed whether the review should be taken 
as positive or a negative feedback). Currently used python alone for doing sentiment analysis.
